# DE2-Accumulator
This project is aimed to create an accumulator using the Altera DE2 board. It does both unsigned and signed addition/subtraction and is dispalyed on the seven segment displays

From this project I learned: 
1. The creation of an ALU for accumulation
2. Transferring to an N-bit Shift Register design to account for 32-bit inputs and outputs
3. Control of LEDs on Altera DE2 board to signal if switches are up or down along with the setting of zero and negative flags
